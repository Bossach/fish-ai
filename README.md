# About

`fish-ai` adds AI functionality to [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com).

This is a fork of [Tom DÃ¶rr's `fish.codex` repository](https://github.com/tom-doerr/codex.fish).
It uses the [chat completions API endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)
and is powered by a self-hosted LLM. It has been tested against
[Llama GPT](https://github.com/getumbrel/llama-gpt) but should work with other models as well.

## How to install

1. Create a configuration file called `.config/fish-ai.ini`. It should look something like this:

```ini
[fish-ai]
server = https://your-server/v1
api_key = sk-XXXXXXXXXXXX
model = code-llama-13b-chat.gguf
```

2. Install the OpenAI package.

```shell
pip3 install openai
```

3. Install the plugin itself. You can install it using [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher).

```shell
fisher install realiserad/fish-ai
```
